# Recipe Project

This project preprocesses a recipe dataset and provides content-based recipe recommendations. 

It cleans the data, extracts key information like ingredients, categories, keywords, and images, and generates TF-IDF vectors for each recipe. The recommendation function suggests recipes based on user preferences, ratings, cooking time, and calorie requirements.
